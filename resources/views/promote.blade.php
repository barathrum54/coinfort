            <h3>How Does It Works?</h3>
            <p>By promoting your project, you are having the chance of reaching 100k+ people. Promotional campaigns attract
                average of 10k+ investers weekly. With right tools you can achieve higher numbers, feel free to ask about it
                to our blockchain experienced marketing team.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why Should I Do It?</h3>
            <p>Creating a theme and sustaining tokenomics is always good. But who knows about it? A good project
                unfortunately requires more than experienced team and honest work. Without letting people know about it,
                it's just an elf in the shelf. Bring down your precious idea from the shelf and let the public know about
                it. With these numbers your community will increase significantly and your projects chance of mooning will
                be sky high. </p>

            <h3>Alright, How Should I Do It?</h3>
            <p>First things first, have a solid plan and let your community know about it. Look for platforms which are
                reaching thousands of people daily. Take your time and browse the deepest dungeons of blockchain network.
            </p>
            <p>Take daily actions. Listing in one place is never enough(unfortunately, sigh). Put your ads wherever you can,
                also examine the both platforms and your campaign before taking costly actions.</p>
            <p>Start taking notes because we are about to give you the secret recipe of 100x project;</p>
            <br>

            <h4><b>Decide what you want to do</b></h4>
            <p>Meme token or a project with proper real life usecase. We saw both worked very well with specific
                circumstances, so never stay back to achieve what you want.</p>
            <h4><b>Have a catchy name</b>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Follow the trends on the market and take your time to find an original idea. Don't be stubborn if the rings doesn't bell. It's almost like fishing, nobody can guarantee the fish on the first time. If you swing your rod enough, eventually you can catch a great fish.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Work Hard</b></h4>
            <p>It's not easy, not at all. Prepare yourself to stay awake for couple days. Never forget this is a proper race
                and only the fittest will survive.</p>
            <h4><b>Read More</b></h4>
            <p>Read every single piece of text about your idea and profession to achieve the things you want. Best and the cheapest experience is someone elses experience.</p>
            <h4><b>Work Harder</b></h4>
            <p>"Work smarter not harder" is a common pitfall. Don't fall for it if you don't have the enough experience. If you want something more than sleep, then sacrifice your safe-zone and personal time for that. Patience is bitter as f*** but it's fruit is real tasty.</p>
            <h4><b>Behave</b></h4>
            <p>Believe or not, karma will get you eventually. Scamming is a thievery and honorless act. If you don't pickpocket random people on street, do not scam people online.</p>
            <h4><b>Don't go for the cheap</b></h4>
            <p>We do have a team which is pretty experienced in all kinds of services in these lands. And believe or not, they lost some big money on the path of this experience. One of the main reasons of cash loss was choosing the cheapest option. Price is one of the least important factors in the market of critical services. If your projects success depends on publicity, never go cheap. </p>
