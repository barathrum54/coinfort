            preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use

            use to access the&nbsp;Website. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data
            that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this

        <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not
            necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will
            however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice
            and applicable law.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h3>
        <p>In Short:&nbsp;We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers
            who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our Website.</p>
        <p>The&nbsp;Website&nbsp;may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may

            privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
            other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
            longer than&nbsp;the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
            anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
            stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any

            can:</p>

            the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will
            then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with you, for example to send

            service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you may:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
            feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
            browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
            other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
            tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
            version of this privacy notice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

            writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
        <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with&nbsp;the Website, you
